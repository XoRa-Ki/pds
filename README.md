# Pik-Sim

A code that aim to simulate a day (or more ?) in the world of Pikmin.

Main goals :
- Create a C code architecture to emulate a Pikmin day
- Adding some variables to affect the pathing (prioritize this type of pikmin instead of this one, ...)
- Simulate days using random factors (emplacement of walls, items, ennemis, etc.)
- Being able to tweek some variables (for exemple by using presets, like Pikmin 1, 2, 3 or 4)
- Being able to visualize the simulation (not in command line)

This is a simulation, by so the goal is not to play it but moreso to let it play itself.

(I'm creating this because I got the idea but I don't think I will actually commit on this project until September at least)
